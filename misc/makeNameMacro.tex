%%% Depends on "misc/commandutils.tex"

%%% Given a command whose value represents a name, creates a new macro that represents the plural of that name.
%%% For example, the following:
%%%   \newcommand{\myFavouriteBread}{toast}
%%%   \makePluralMacro{myFavouriteBread}
%%% will create a new macro \toastpl that will evaluate to toasts.
%%% As an optional argument one may pass an alternative ending replacing "s".
%%% For instance, the plural of patch should be patches so you should use
%%%   \makePluralMacro[es]{patch}
\newcommand{\makePluralMacro}[2][s]{\expandafter\newcommand\csname #2pl\endcsname{\runCommandByName{#2}#1}}
